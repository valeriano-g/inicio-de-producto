            Python is a high-level and easy-to-learn programming language. It
            was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since gained great
            popularity in different fields, such as data science, web
            development and desktop application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the main advantages of Python is its clear and concise
            syntax, which makes it ideal for beginners in programming. It also
            has a large number of libraries and frameworks that facilitate the
            development of applications in different areas. Python has a large
            number of libraries that can be used in different projects. Some of
            the most common libraries include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              NumPy: Provides support for working with arrays and data arrays in
              Python.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pandas: provides tools for data analysis and manipulation in
              Python.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matplotlib: allows you to create graphs and data visualizations in
              Python.
            </li>

          <p>Here are some interesting things about the Python language</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python is a high-level programming language, meaning it's designed
              to be easy for humans to read and write, rather than easy for
              machines to run.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is a multipurpose programming language, which means it can
              be used for a wide variety of purposes, from web programming and
              data science to artificial intelligence and task automation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is a widely used language in industry and academia, which
              means that there is a high demand for professionals who know how
              to use it and who can get a good job if they have Python skills.

            Python and PHP are two different programming languages. Python is a
            high-level, multipurpose and open-source programming language, while
            PHP is a programming language specific to web application
            development. Python is widely used in many areas.

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            To write "Hello, World!" in Python, you can use the following code:
            <code> print("Hello, World!") </code>
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, variables are used to store values. You can declare
            variables by assigning a value to a name. For example:
          </p>
          <code> x = 10 y = "Hello, World!" </code>
        </article>
      </section>

        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            To declare a variable in Python, you can simply assign a value to a
            name. For example:
          </p>
          <code> x = 10 y = "Hello, World!" </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, the scope of a variable refers to the part of the program
            where the variable can be accessed. There are two types of variable
            scope in Python:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Global scope: A global variable is one that is defined outside of
              any function or class, and can be accessed from anywhere in the
              program.
            </li>
            <li>
              Local scope: A local variable is one that is defined inside a
              function or class, and can only be accessed from within that
              function or class.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            To declare a global variable in Python, you can use the "global"
            keyword before the variable name. For example:
          </p>
          <code> def my_function(): global x x = 10 </code>
          <p>
            This will make the variable "x" global, and it can be accessed from
            anywhere in the program.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, you can define a function using the "def" keyword,
            followed by the function name and the function's parameters. For
            example:
          </p>
          <code> def my_function(x, y): return x + y </code>
          <p>
            This function takes two parameters, "x" and "y", and returns their
            sum.
          </p>
